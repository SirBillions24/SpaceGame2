# Robber Baron Castle Progression System (Levels 1-80)

## Overview

Robber Baron Castles are the primary PvE targets in Good Game Empire, providing resources, gold, rubies, XP, and commander equipment. They scale in difficulty from Level 1 (requiring 3 Macemen) to Level 80 (requiring hundreds of elite veteran troops with multiple waves).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Progressive difficulty scaling across 80 levels
- Multiple sub-variations per level (e.g., 10.1, 10.2, 10.3)
- Randomized defensive configurations to prevent memorization
- Increasing attacks required to defeat castle as levels rise
- Substantial rewards that scale with difficulty

  - 0 Mantlets (not yet needed)
```

#### Levels 11-25: Moderate Tools
```
Siege Tools:
  - 4-10 Scaling Ladders
  - 4-9 Battering Rams
Defense Tools:
  - 10-28 Mantlets (to reduce losses)
```

#### Levels 26-50: Heavy Tools
```
Siege Tools:
  - 6-12 Scaling Ladders per flank
  - 5-10 Battering Rams
Defense Tools:
  - 15-30 Mantlets (essential for survival)
```

#### Levels 51-80: Maximum Tools
```
Siege Tools:
  - 7-12 Scaling Ladders per flank (28-36 total)
  - 6-19 Battering Rams (for 135%+ gates)
Defense Tools:
  - 20-31 Mantlets per wave (80-124 total)
  - Critical for protecting Vhc from ranged defenders
```

### Wave Composition Strategy

#### Single Wave (Levels 1-5)
```
Attack: 2-13 troops total
Strategy: Overwhelm single defender
Example: Level 1 = 3 Macemen
```

#### Two Waves (Levels 6-15)
```
Wave 1: Initial assault with tools
Wave 2: Cleanup force
Example: Level 15 = 25 Ths (W1) + 25 Ths (W2)
```

#### Three Waves (Levels 16-40)
```
Wave 1: Tool deployment + initial force (25-42 troops)
Wave 2: Main assault (25-42 troops)
Wave 3: Courtyard cleanup (20-40 troops)
Example: Level 36 = 38 Ths + tools (W1) + 38 Vmm (W2) + courtyard force (W3)
```

#### Four+ Waves (Levels 41-80)
```
Wave 1: Right flank with maximum ladders (52-64 Vhc)
Wave 2: Continuation of flank assault (52-64 Vhc)
Wave 3: Continuation of flank assault (52-64 Vhc)
Wave 4: Front assault with rams + courtyard sweep (150+ Vhc)
Strategy: Systematic elimination of each defensive position
Example: Level 67.16 = 4 waves of 52-156 Vhc with martyrs
```

### Martyr Usage (Levels 20+)

**Purpose:** Absorb defensive tool damage (Flaming Arrows, Tar Pitch) without losing valuable troops

**Typical Deployment:**
```
Wave 1: Martyr on vulnerable flank
Real troops follow in Wave 2+ after tools are consumed
```

**Example Level 67.15:**
```
Wave 1:
  Left: 52 Vmm + 10 lad + 22 man
  Front: 156 Vmm + 9 ram + 10 lad + 26 man
  Right: 52 Vmm + 8 lad
Losses: 3 Vmm (1 left + 2 courtyard)
```

## Troop Loss Management

### Early Game (Levels 1-15)
```
Expected Losses: 0-3 troops per attack
Strategy: Efficient low-cost troops (Macemen, Crossbowmen)
Cost: Negligible (10-50 coins per attack)
```

### Mid Game (Levels 16-35)
```
Expected Losses: 2-7 troops per attack
Strategy: Use Veteran troops, employ Mantlets
Cost: 100-500 coins per attack
Critical: Start using martyrs to absorb tool damage
```

### Mid-Late Game (Levels 36-50)
```
Expected Losses: 1-15 troops per attack
Strategy: Heavy Mantlet usage (20-30 per wave)
Cost: 500-2,000 coins per attack
Critical: Proper commander bonuses reduce losses by 50%+
```

### Late Game (Levels 51-80)
```
Expected Losses: 0-13 troops per attack (with optimal strategy)
Strategy:
  - Maximum Mantlet protection (20-31 per wave)
  - Martyrs on all tool-heavy flanks
  - Veteran Heavy Crossbowmen (Vhc) primary force
  - Perfect commander optimization
Cost: 2,000-5,000 coins per attack
Critical: One mistake = 20-50+ troop losses
```

**Zero-Loss Strategies:**
Some configurations allow for 0 losses with perfect execution:
- Using maximum Mantlets (28-31)
- Attacking flanks with no defenders
- Overwhelming force (200+ troops vs. 50 defenders)

**Example Level 67.10:**
```
Defender: 260 Archers (right flank only)
Attack: Any unit + 28 Mantlets (right)
Losses: 0 (Mantlets negate all ranged attacks)
```

---

## Key Strategic Considerations

### Spying Requirements
**Levels 1-20:** Optional (patterns are simple)
**Levels 21-40:** Recommended (saves resources)
**Levels 41-80:** Mandatory (sub-variations require precise counters)

### Tool Consumption Rates

| Level Range | Ladders per Level | Rams per Level | Mantlets per Level |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1-10 | 0-20 | 0-8 | 0 |
| 11-25 | 20-70 | 20-70 | 50-200 |
| 26-40 | 80-250 | 60-180 | 300-800 |
| 41-60 | 250-600 | 150-400 | 800-2,000 |
| 61-80 | 600-1,000+ | 400-800 | 2,000-3,500 |

### Resource Efficiency

**Early Game Focus:** Attack frequently, losses don't matter
**Mid Game Focus:** Balance speed with efficiency
**Late Game Focus:** Perfect execution required, costs are enormous

**Gold Per Attack Hour (Estimate):**
- Level 10: ~40-60 gold/hour
- Level 25: ~90-120 gold/hour
- Level 40: ~200-300 gold/hour
- Level 70: ~200-250 gold/hour (slower but massive individual rewards)

---

## Special Defensive Configurations

### Empty Flank Configurations
**Levels 15-80:** Some variations have completely empty flanks
**Strategy:** Attack empty flank with minimal force (1-52 troops)
**Example Level 67.10:**
```
Left: Empty
Front: Empty  
Right: 260 Archers
Attack: Any unit on right with 28 Mantlets = 0 losses
```

### Courtyard-Only Defense
**Levels 35-80:** Rare but potent
**Configuration:** No flank defenders, 500-3,000 courtyard troops
**Strategy:** Requires multiple full waves to eliminate courtyard

**Example Level 69.11:**
```
Flanks: 117 Sm (left), 96 Sm (front), 47 Sm (right)
Courtyard: 2,984 Swordsmen
Attack: 4 waves of 52-156 Vhc each
```

### Ranged-Heavy Defense
**Levels 20-80:** Configurations with 80%+ ranged units
**Tools Required:** Maximum Mantlets (20-31 per wave)
**Weakness:** Vulnerable to melee if tools are negated

### Melee-Heavy Defense
**Levels 30-80:** Configurations with massive Swordsmen/Spearmen armies
**Strategy:** Ranged attack from distance, use Veteran Heavy Crossbowmen
**Advantage:** Mantlets protect attackers perfectly
