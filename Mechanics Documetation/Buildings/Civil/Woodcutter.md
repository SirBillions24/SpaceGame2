## Low Level Building System

The game features a **fast-track building system** for lower-level players, allowing them to construct Woodcutters at reduced time and cost:

| 11 | 13 Wood | 00:05:00 |
| 12 | 13 Wood | 00:05:00 |

### Level 2 Woodcutter - Low Level Stats

| Player Level | Cost | Build Time (hh:mm:ss) |
|--------------|------|----------------------|
| 1 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:00:30 |
| 2 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:00:09 |
| 3 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:00:09 |
| 4 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:00:12 |
| 5 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:00:30 |
| 6 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:00:50 |
| 7 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:01:15 |
| 8 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:01:40 |
| 9 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:03:20 |
| 10 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:10:00 |
| 11 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:10:00 |
| 12 | 50 Wood + 20 Stone | 00:10:00 |

### Level 3 Woodcutter - Low Level Stats

| Player Level | Cost | Build Time (hh:mm:ss) |
|--------------|------|----------------------|
| 8 | 142 Wood + 76 Stone | 00:05:00 |
| 9 | 142 Wood + 76 Stone | 00:06:30 |
| 10 | 142 Wood + 76 Stone | 00:15:00 |
| 11 | 142 Wood + 76 Stone | 00:15:00 |
| 12 | 142 Wood + 76 Stone | 00:15:00 |

### Level 4 Woodcutter - Low Level Stats

| Player Level | Cost | Build Time (hh:mm:ss) |
|--------------|------|----------------------|
| 12 | 441 Wood + 441 Stone | 00:37:30 |

**Note**: The low-level system provides significant acceleration for new players, with build times ranging from 2 seconds to 37.5 minutes compared to standard construction times.

## Strategic Notes

### Resource Priority
Wood is the **primary resource** in Good Game Empire:
- Required for nearly all building construction
- Essential for tool production
- Needed for alliance contributions
- Critical for kingdom unlocks

### Upgrade Recommendations
1. **Early Game**: Prioritize multiple Level 1-3 Woodcutters for rapid expansion
2. **Mid Game**: Focus on upgrading to Levels 5-7 for balanced production
3. **Late Game**: Maximize to Level 11 for optimal output

### Resource Comparison (vs Stone Quarry)
- **Level requirement**: Available at Level 1 (vs Level 2 for Stone Quarry)
- **Production**: Identical production rates per level
- **Cost structure**: Generally requires more stone per upgrade than Stone Quarry requires wood

### Efficiency Calculations

#### Daily Production (24 hours)
| Building Level | Wood/Day | Cumulative Production (1-10 Woodcutters) |
|----------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | 192 | 1,920 |
| 5 | 672 | 6,720 |
| 10 | 1,512 | 15,120 |
| 11 | 1,728 | 17,280 |

### Alternative Production Methods
- **Forest Lodge**: Enhanced wood production building
- **Relic Woodcutter**: Premium wood production option
- **Build Items**: Attach to woodcutters for production bonuses
- **Research/Skills**: May provide percentage boosts to production

### Defensive Considerations
- Classified as "Smashable Building" - can be destroyed during attacks
- Consider protective placement within castle layout
- Rebuild quickly after attacks using low-level fast construction if needed

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Levels 1-7**: Relatively affordable upgrades with good production gains
- **Levels 8-9**: Moderate cost increase, steady production improvement
- **Levels 10-11**: Exponential cost, diminishing returns per resource invested
  - Level 10→11 upgrade requires 106,000 total resources for only +9 wood/hour
  - Best suited for end-game optimization rather than early expansion
