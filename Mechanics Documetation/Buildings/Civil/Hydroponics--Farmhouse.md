## Key Game Mechanics

### 1. Building Categories
- **Civil Building**
- **Smashable Building** (can be destroyed in attacks)

### 2. Placement Options
- Can be placed in the **Relic Food District** (as of September 2024)
- Regular castle placement

### 3. Late-Game Strategy
At legendary levels, it's recommended to demolish Farmhouses and replace with:
- **Granary**
- **Relic Greenhouse**
- **Relic Conservatory**

*These provide superior food production at higher levels.*

### 4. Production Scaling
- **Linear progression**: +8 food/hour per level
- **Total production increase**: 5.5x (16 → 88) from level 1 to 10

### 5. Resource Cost Scaling
- **Wood costs**: Increase ~179x from level 1 to 10
- **Stone costs**: Start at level 2, increase ~526x to level 10
- **Experience points**: Scale from 3 to 29 (9.67x increase)

## Historical Updates

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| **Pre-August 2011** | Initial release |
| **February 29, 2012** | Level cap raised from 9 to 10 |
| **November 11, 2013** | Visual appearance revised |
| **May 17, 2019** | Fixed food production bug when moving buildings; adjusted workload distribution |
| **September 18, 2024** | Can now be stored in Food District |

## Strategic Insights

### Early Game
- Essential for basic food production
- Take advantage of reduced construction times

### Mid Game
- Scale up all farmhouses to maximize food output
- Balance wood and stone resource allocation

### Late Game
- Replace with more efficient buildings (Granary, Relic buildings)
- Consider placement in Relic Food District for bonuses

### Key Considerations
- The building becomes **less efficient** at higher levels due to escalating costs vs. linear production increases
- Low-level players benefit from **dramatically reduced construction times** to accelerate early progression
- Food production is **critical** - soldiers will desert without adequate supply
