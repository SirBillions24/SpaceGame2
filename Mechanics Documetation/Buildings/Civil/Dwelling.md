# Dwelling - Good Game Empire

## Overview
The **Dwelling** is a civil building that determines your castle population. It serves as the foundation for citizen management, affecting taxes, armed citizens, and defensive capabilities.

### Building Characteristics
- **Maximum Levels**: 12
- **Category**: Civil Building, Smashable Building
- **Premium Alternative**: Town House (ruby-only, cannot be burned, higher population)
- **Maximum Population per Building**: 85 citizens (Level 12)

---

## Core Mechanics

### Population System
Population represents the number of citizens in your castle or outpost. Population affects:
1. **Tax Revenue**: More citizens = more coins from tax collector
2. **Armed Citizens**: Citizens available for castle defense
3. **Public Order**: Higher population reduces public order (negative effect)

### Public Order Impact
- Each dwelling **decreases** public order
- Reduced public order **lowers productivity** of wood, stone, and food buildings
- Must be balanced with decorative items to maintain efficiency
- Higher-level dwellings have **significantly larger** public order penalties

### Armed Citizens Defense
- Armed citizens provide passive castle defense
- Effectiveness varies by castellan equipment and location
- **Optimal use**: Capital city in Beyond the Horizon with Son of the North castellan set
  - Can nullify up to 32 attackers with proper setup
- Less effective in standard castles but still provides baseline defense

### Population Growth Analysis
- **Level 1→2**: +50% increase (10 → 15)
- **Level 9→10**: +20% increase (50 → 60)
- **Level 11→12**: +13.3% increase (75 → 85)
- **Total growth**: 10 to 85 citizens (750% increase)

### Public Order Impact Analysis
- **Critical Point**: Level 12 dwelling causes **-85 Public Order**
- **Compensation Required**: Need decorations with 2,500+ PO to offset one Level 12 dwelling
- **Scaling**: Public order penalty scales exactly with population increase

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages ✓
1. **Tax Income**: High population generates substantial coin income from tax collector
2. **Defensive Capability**: Can nullify attackers with proper castellan setup (especially in Beyond the Horizon)
3. **Armed Citizens**: Provides baseline castle defense against small raids
4. **Strategic Flexibility**: Can build multiple dwellings for population scaling

### Disadvantages ✗
1. **Public Order Reduction**: Significantly decreases productivity of resource buildings
2. **Food Consumption**: During food shortage, accelerates soldier desertion
3. **Upgrade Costs**: High-level dwellings require massive resource investment
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Requires substantial decoration investment to maintain public order
5. **Modern Meta**: Most players remove dwellings in favor of farming coins from NPCs and events

### When to Use Dwellings
**Recommended scenarios:**
- Completing daily tasks requiring tax collection
- Beyond the Horizon capital defense strategy
- Storm Islands outposts (doesn't affect main castle public order)
- Early game when tax income matters

**Not recommended for:**
- Main castle optimization (public order too costly)
- Advanced players (better coin farming alternatives exist)
- Resource-focused castle builds

## Strategic Analysis

### Public Order Management
**Problem**: Level 12 dwelling causes -85 Public Order

**Solutions**:
1. **Event Decorations**: Typically provide 2,500+ PO per item
2. **Multiple Decorations**: Stack several decorations to offset multiple dwellings
3. **Strategic Placement**: Build dwellings in outposts where PO doesn't affect main castle

### Tax Revenue Calculations

#### Example: 5 Dwellings at Level 12
- **Population**: 5 × 85 = 425 citizens
- **Tax per collection**: 5 × 36 = 180 coins
- **Daily collections**: Varies by player activity
- **Public Order cost**: -425 PO (requires multiple event decorations to offset)

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Cost**: Massive resource investment + decoration requirements
- **Benefit**: Modest coin income (easily surpassed by NPC farming)
- **Verdict**: Generally not worth it for advanced players

### Alternative Strategies

#### Storm Islands Approach
- Build dwellings exclusively in Storm Islands outposts
- **Advantage**: Doesn't affect main castle's public order
- **Use case**: Tax collection for daily tasks without main castle penalty
- **Requirement**: Must maintain Storm Islands outposts

#### Beyond the Horizon Defense
- **Setup**: Capital city with maximum dwellings + Son of the North castellan set
- **Effect**: Armed citizens can nullify up to 32 attackers
- **Limitation**: Very specific use case, requires premium castellan equipment
- **Population target**: 500-1000+ armed citizens for optimal defense

### Modern Meta Perspective
Current game meta **discourages** dwelling usage because:
1. **NPC Farming**: More efficient coin generation from attacking NPCs
2. **Event Rewards**: Better coin sources from kingdom events
3. **Public Order**: Too costly to maintain with decorations
4. **Food Burden**: Exacerbates food shortages

**Exception**: Players focusing on daily task completion may maintain limited dwellings for tax collection requirements.

## Detailed Cost Analysis

### Total Resource Investment (Level 1 → 12)

| Resource Type | Total Amount Required |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Wood | 98,372 |
| Stone | 130,994 |
| **Total Resources** | **229,366** |

### Upgrade Economics
- **Most expensive upgrade**: Level 11→12 (54,910 wood + 65,840 stone = 120,750 total)
- **Best value upgrade**: Level 1→2 (79 wood + 47 stone = 126 total, +5 population)
- **Worst value upgrade**: Level 11→12 (120,750 resources for +10 population)

### Per-Population-Point Cost
- **Level 1→2**: 25.2 resources per population point
- **Level 11→12**: 12,075 resources per population point
- **Efficiency loss**: 479× more expensive per population point at high levels

## Comparison: Dwelling vs Town House

| Aspect | Dwelling | Town House |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Cost | Wood + Stone | Rubies only |
| Can be burned | Yes | No |
| Population (Level 12) | 85 | 115 |
| Public Order (Level 12) | -85 | -85 |
| Max total cost | 120,750 resources | 14,300 rubies |
| Accessibility | All players | Premium only |

**Key Difference**: Town House provides 30 more population per building and cannot be destroyed in attacks, but requires significant ruby investment.
