# Town House - Good Game Empire

## Overview
The **Town House** is a premium civil building that provides higher population capacity than regular Dwellings. It requires rubies to build and upgrade, but offers significant advantages including immunity to burning attacks.

### Building Characteristics
- **Maximum Levels**: 12
- **Category**: Civil Building (Ruby Only)
- **Regular Alternative**: Dwelling (wood/stone cost, can be burned, lower population)
- **Maximum Population per Building**: 115 citizens (Level 12)
- **Key Advantage**: **Cannot be burned or destroyed** in attacks

---

## Core Mechanics

### Population System
Identical to Dwelling:
- Increases castle/outpost population
- Generates tax revenue
- Provides armed citizens for defense
- Reduces public order

### Public Order Impact
- Same penalties as Dwelling at equivalent levels
- Level 12: **-85 Public Order** (same as Dwelling Level 12)
- Requires substantial decoration compensation

### Defensive Advantage
**Critical Difference from Dwelling:**
- **Immune to fire attacks** - cannot be destroyed
- Guarantees stable population even after raids
- Particularly valuable for:
  - Tax-focused strategies
  - Defense-oriented builds
  - Long-term population investments

## Comparative Analysis: Town House vs Dwelling

### Population Efficiency

| Level | Town House Population | Dwelling Population | Difference | Advantage |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 20 | 10 | +10 | +100% |
| 3 | 33 | 20 | +13 | +65% |
| 6 | 53 | 35 | +18 | +51.4% |
| 9 | 72 | 50 | +22 | +44% |
| 12 | 115 | 85 | +30 | +35.3% |

**Analysis:**
- Town House provides **35.3% more population** at max level
- Percentage advantage **decreases** at higher levels
- Early levels show proportionally higher gains

### Public Order Comparison

| Level | Town House PO | Dwelling PO | Difference |
|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | -10 | -10 | Same |
| 6 | -35 | -35 | Same |
| 12 | -85 | -85 | Same |

**Conclusion**: Public order penalties are **identical** at equivalent levels. Town House's higher population at same PO cost makes it more efficient.

### Cost Comparison

#### Town House (PC Version)
- **Type**: Ruby cost
- **Level 1-12 Total**: 52,790 rubies
- **Average per level**: 4,399 rubies

#### Dwelling
- **Type**: Resource cost
- **Level 1-12 Total**: 229,366 resources (wood + stone)
- **Average per level**: 19,114 resources

**Ruby Value Assessment:**
- Rubies are premium currency
- Cannot directly convert to resources
- Town House costs are significant real money investment
- Dwelling costs are time-based (resource production)

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Build Town Houses

**Recommended scenarios:**
1. **Ruby abundance**: Players with disposable premium currency
2. **Defense priority**: Need stable population immune to attacks
3. **Beyond the Horizon defense**: Capital city armed citizen strategy
4. **Tax optimization**: Maximizing coin income per building slot
5. **Long-term investment**: Permanent population boost

**Not recommended for:**
1. **F2P players**: Ruby cost prohibitive
2. **Resource focus**: Better uses for rubies (production buildings, tools)
3. **Early game**: Population less important initially
4. **Modern meta**: NPC farming more efficient for coins

### Ruby Investment Analysis

#### Single Town House (Level 12)
- **Cost**: 52,790 rubies (PC) or 54,490 rubies (Mobile)
- **Benefit**: 115 population (+30 vs Dwelling)
- **Permanence**: Cannot be destroyed

#### Alternative Ruby Uses
**For comparison, 52,790 rubies could buy:**
- Multiple high-level Bakeries (-40% food consumption each)
- Tool production acceleration
- Event packages
- Other premium buildings

### Public Order Management

**Challenge**: Level 12 Town House = -85 PO

**Required Compensation:**
- Need decorations worth 2,500+ PO each
- Event decorations typically provide sufficient PO
- Multiple Town Houses require multiple decorations

**Formula**: Target decorations = (Number of Town Houses × 85) ÷ 2,500
- 1 Town House = ~1 event decoration needed
- 5 Town Houses = ~2 event decorations needed
- 10 Town Houses = ~4 event decorations needed

---

## Advanced Strategies

### Maximum Population Build

**Setup (PC Version):**
- Build maximum number of Town House slots in castle
- Upgrade all to Level 12
- Total ruby cost: 52,790 × number of buildings

**Example: 10 Town Houses**
- Total cost: 527,900 rubies
- Total population: 1,150 citizens
- Total tax revenue: 360 coins per collection
- Public order penalty: -850 PO
- Required decorations: ~4 event decorations (2,500+ PO each)

### Hybrid Strategy

**Optimal approach for most players:**
1. Build 2-3 Town Houses (priority locations)
2. Use Dwellings for remaining slots
3. Focus Town Houses in defensive positions
4. Keep Dwellings where burn risk is acceptable

**Ruby efficiency:**
- 2-3 Town Houses: 105,580-158,370 rubies
- Provides core population stability
- Remaining population from cheaper Dwellings

## Ruby Cost Breakdown

### Early Game Investment (Levels 1-6)

| Level Range | Ruby Cost | Population Gained | Ruby per Population Point |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1-3 | 1,050 | 13 | 80.8 |
| 4-6 | 5,150 | 20 | 257.5 |

**Analysis**: Early levels provide better ruby-to-population value.

### Mid Game Investment (Levels 7-9)

| Level Range | Ruby Cost | Population Gained | Ruby per Population Point |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 7-9 | 14,940 | 13 | 1,149.2 |

**Analysis**: Mid levels show diminishing returns.

### Late Game Investment (Levels 10-12) - PC

| Level Range | Ruby Cost | Population Gained | Ruby per Population Point |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 10-12 | 31,650 | 30 | 1,055 |

**Analysis**: Level 10-12 provides large population jumps but at high ruby cost.

## Mobile vs PC Differences

### Cost Comparison

| Aspect | PC Version | Mobile Version | Difference |
|--------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Level 11 Cost | 8,900 rubies | 10,600 rubies | +1,700 rubies |
| Total Cost (1-12) | 52,790 rubies | 54,490 rubies | +1,700 rubies |
| All other stats | Identical | Identical | None |

**Explanation**: Mobile version has single higher cost at Level 11. All population, public order, and XP values are identical across platforms.

## Verdict: Is Town House Worth It?

### For Ruby Spenders: **CONDITIONAL YES**
**Pros:**
- Cannot be destroyed (major advantage)
- 35% more population than Dwelling
- Same public order cost as Dwelling
- Permanent investment

**Cons:**
- Massive ruby cost (52,790-54,490 per building)
- Better ruby investments may exist
- Population value diminished in modern meta

**Recommendation**: Build 2-4 Town Houses maximum for core population stability.

---

### For F2P Players: **NO**
**Reasons:**
- Ruby cost prohibitive
- Dwellings provide 74% of the population for free (resources only)
- Rubies better spent on Bakery, tools, or events
- Modern coin farming doesn't require high population

**Alternative**: Use Dwellings exclusively, accept burn risk, rebuild when needed using fast construction.

---

### Modern Meta Perspective

**Current game state:**
- Population less valuable than in early game years
- NPC farming provides better coin income than taxes
- Event rewards surpass tax collection
- Public order penalties costly to manage

**Town House usage in 2024+:**
- Niche use in Beyond the Horizon defense
- Limited value in standard gameplay
- Mostly for completionist or whale players
- Historical artifact from when taxes mattered more

**Final Assessment**: Town House is a **luxury building** with limited practical advantage in modern gameplay, primarily valuable for its indestructibility rather than raw population benefit.
