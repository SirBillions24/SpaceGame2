## Strategic Notes

### Resource Planning
- Stone is consistently needed throughout gameplay progression
- Higher-level buildings require significantly more stone
- Multiple Stone Quarries recommended for efficient progression

### Upgrade Priority
- Essential early-game building
- Should be upgraded regularly alongside other resource buildings
- Level 11 provides substantial production boost (72/hour)

### Efficiency Considerations
- Production scales non-linearly with level
- Later levels require disproportionately more resources to upgrade
- Balance number of quarries vs. upgrade levels based on needs

### Alternative Production Methods
- **Stone Works**: Enhanced stone production building
- **Relic Quarry**: Premium stone production option
- Consider build item attachments for additional production bonuses
