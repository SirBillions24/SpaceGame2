## Storage Capacity Strategies

### Additional Storage Sources

The Storehouse capacity can be **supplemented** by:

**1. Build Items (Attachments)**
- Attach to production buildings
- Higher level attachments = more storage
- Stackable with base Storehouse capacity

**2. Relic Resource Buildings (Level 11+)**
- **Wood**: +30,000 capacity
- **Stone**: +30,000 capacity  
- **Food**: +60,000 capacity
- Significant boost to standard resources

**3. Refinery**
- Increases Wood and Stone storage capacity
- Percentage-based bonus

**4. Toolsmith**
- Increases Kingdom Resource storage (Iron Ore, Charcoal, Olive Oil, Glass)
- Essential for kingdom content progression

**5. Flank Unit Limit (Temporary Build Items)**
- Some temporary build items attached to Storehouse
- Increase flank unit limit for attacks
- Range: 15% minimum to 60% maximum

### Optimization Formula

**Total Effective Storage** = 
```
Storehouse Base Capacity
+ Relic Building Bonuses
+ Build Item Bonuses
+ Refinery/Toolsmith Percentages
```

**Example (Level 7 Storehouse):**
- Base capacity: 80,000
- Relic Woodcutter L11: +30,000 wood
- Refinery bonus: +10% = +11,000 wood
- Build item attachment: +5,000 wood
- **Total Wood Storage**: 126,000

## Upgrade Priority Guide

### Critical Upgrade Thresholds

**Level 3** (12,500 capacity):
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **When**: Within first 2 weeks
- **Reason**: Required for basic progression, multiple building upgrades

**Level 5** (40,000 capacity):
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **When**: Month 1-2
- **Reason**: Needed for mid-tier army development

**Level 7** (80,000 capacity):
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **When**: Month 2-4
- **Reason**: Sufficient for most content long-term

**Level 8** (100,000 capacity):
- **Priority**: LOW
- **When**: After reaching Legendary 35 and completing Hall of Legends
- **Reason**: Only needed for specific legendary content

**Level 9** (250,000 capacity):
- **Priority**: VERY LOW
- **When**: End-game only, after maxing other priorities
- **Reason**: Massive capacity mostly unnecessary for regular gameplay

### Recommended Upgrade Path

**New Players (Weeks 1-4):**
1. Level 1 → 2: Immediately
2. Level 2 → 3: Day 2-3
3. Level 3 → 4: Week 1
4. Level 4 → 5: Week 2-3

## Resource Management Tips

### When Storage is Full

**Short-term solutions:**
1. **Use resources immediately**: Upgrade buildings, train troops
2. **Trade/Donate**: Alliance donations, trading posts
3. **Craft items**: Convert resources into tools/items
4. **Attack/Raid**: Spend resources on military actions

**Long-term solutions:**
1. **Upgrade Storehouse**: Permanent capacity increase
2. **Build Relic structures**: Additional storage bonuses
3. **Attach build items**: Small incremental gains
4. **Refinery/Toolsmith**: Percentage bonuses

### Storage Planning for Large Upgrades

**Example**: Building requires 150,000 wood (Level 7 Storehouse = 80,000 capacity)

**Strategy**:
1. Use Relic Woodcutter L11 (+30,000) → 110,000 capacity
2. Attach build item (+10,000) → 120,000 capacity
3. Use Refinery bonus (+15%) → 138,000 capacity
4. Collect from multiple sources simultaneously
5. Time upgrade to minimize waste

**Level 8-9**: Required Legendary 655

**Impact**: 
- Essentially gated content for 99.9% of playerbase
- Would take years of continuous grinding
- Only mega-whales could achieve
- Effectively "unreleased" content for most

### Revised Requirements (Post-September 2024)

**Level 8**: Legendary 35 (previously 655)
- **Reduction**: 95% decrease in level requirement
- **New accessibility**: Achievable by dedicated players in 6-12 months

**Level 9**: Legendary 40 (previously 655)
- **Reduction**: 94% decrease in level requirement  
- **New accessibility**: Achievable by very dedicated players in 12-24 months

**Developer Reasoning**: Made legendary Storehouse content actually accessible to committed player base, not just mega-whales.

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to upgrade Storehouse before other buildings?
**A**: Generally yes. If you can't store enough resources to upgrade other buildings, Storehouse becomes your bottleneck.

### Q: What level Storehouse do most players end at?
**A**: **Level 7** (80,000 capacity) is sufficient for 90%+ of players long-term.

### Q: Is Level 8-9 necessary?
**A**: **No.** Only required for specific legendary content. Level 7 handles all standard gameplay.

### Q: How long to reach Level 8 Storehouse?
**A**: Post-September 2024 changes: 8-16 months of active play to reach requirements + farm tokens.

### Q: Can I have multiple Storehouses?
**A**: **No.** Limit of **one per castle/outpost**.

### Q: What happens if my storage is full?
**A**: Cannot collect resources from production buildings until space available. Resources aren't lost, just can't collect them.

### Q: Should I prioritize Storehouse in every outpost?
**A**: Yes for primary outposts. Low priority for Storm Islands or temporary outposts.

## Final Recommendations

### Universal Advice
1. **Always keep Storehouse upgraded to match your needs**
