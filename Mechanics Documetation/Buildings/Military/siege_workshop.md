# Siege Workshop

## Overview
The Siege Workshop is a military building where siege tools are produced. Only one can be built in each castle and/or outpost. Players use this building to create offensive tools that help overcome enemy defenses during attacks.

## Tool Categories

### Defensive Reduction Tools
Tools that reduce enemy defensive structures:
- **Wall Tools**: Scaling Ladder, Siege Tower
- **Gate Tools**: Battering Ram, Iron Ram
- **Moat Tools**: Wood Bundle, Assault Bridge
- **Ranged Defense**: Mantlet, Cast Iron Mantlet

### Utility Tools
Tools that provide additional benefits:
- **Looting**: Loot Sack, Loot Cart (increase resource capacity stolen)
- **Glory**: Banner, War Banner (increase glory points earned from victories)

## Strategic Considerations

### Cost Reduction Methods
- Siege tool cost reduction build items
- Resource production optimization

### Production Speed Increases
- **Public Order**: Higher public order increases production speed
- **Forge Building**: Increases production speed by percentage
- **Research Tower**: "Workbench" research increases production speed
- **Glory Titles**: "the Noble" and "the Relentless" increase speed of rams, ladders, and shields (Tier 1)
- Decorations with production speed bonuses

### Tool Selection Strategy
- **Wall/Gate Breaching**: Use ladders and rams for initial defense reduction
- **Moat Crossing**: Essential for castles with moat fortifications
- **Ranged Protection**: Mantlets protect attacking forces from defender arrows
- **Resource Raids**: Loot sacks maximize plunder from successful attacks
- **Glory Farming**: Banners increase glory point gains

## Combat Mechanics

### Tool Effectiveness
- Tools reduce specific defensive bonuses
- Multiple tools of same type stack effects
- Tools are consumed during attack
- Speed affects arrival time with army

### Tool Loss
- Tools are destroyed/lost during battles
- Mantlets have high consumption rate (approximately 720 for 10 attacks)
- Plan tool production to maintain steady supply for campaigns

## Building Features

### Unlocks by Level
- **Level 1**: Basic wall and gate siege equipment
- **Level 2**: Defensive reduction, utility tools (looting, glory), shields
- **Level 3**: Moat crossing equipment

### Important Notes
- Cannot be demolished once built
- One per castle/outpost
- Tools must travel with armies (affects arrival time)
- Resource-based tools more economical for regular use
- Ruby tools faster but expensive for sustained campaigns

## Tool Production Interface
- Slot-based production system
- Can queue multiple tool types
- Production time varies by tool type and quantity
- Tools can be doubled instantly with rubies during production
- Default production quantity set to 80 tools

## Historical Updates (Pre-2018 Era)

### February 2012
- Added unit overview containing soldiers, tools, and special units

### March 2012
- Added option to cancel tool production

### November 2012
- Removed option to cut production time in half
- Replaced with option to double tool amount instantly

### April 2014
- Added feature to change castles while in Siege Workshop menu

### November 2016
- Fixed cost display bug when insufficient resources

### December 2016
- Increased tools per production slot from 5 to 80
- Added "Complete slot" and "Slot after slot" production buttons
- Added total production time display
- Added confirmation dialog for doubling tools
- Modified recruitment interface
- Modified overview panel with unit/tool recruitment switching
- Set default production to 80 tools before production

## Comparison: Resource vs Ruby Tools

### Resource Tools
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective for sustained campaigns, uses renewable resources
- **Disadvantages**: Slower production, requires resource stockpiling

### Ruby Tools
- **Advantages**: Faster travel speed, instant availability
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, limited by ruby availability, not sustainable for frequent attacks

### Recommended Usage
- Use resource tools for regular attacks and farming
- Save ruby tools for critical battles or time-sensitive operations
- Maintain production queue to ensure constant tool availability
