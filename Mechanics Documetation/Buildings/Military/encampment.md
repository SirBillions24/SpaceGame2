# Encampment

## Overview
The Encampment is a military building that enables players to customize and deploy commanders for military operations. It can only be built at the main castle and allows players to lead armies with specialized commander units that provide various bonuses and tactical advantages.

## Building Levels (Classic Era)

### Level Requirements and Stats

| Level | Player Level Required | Cost | Available Commanders |
|-------|---------------------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | 4 | 158 Wood & 83 Stone | 3 |
| 2 | 15 | 1,885 Wood & 1,695 Stone | 6 |
| 3 | 29 | 6,821 Wood & 9,343 Stone | 9 |
| 4 | 42 | 55,005 Wood & 51,740 Stone | 12 |

### Low Level Construction (Accelerated Build Times)

Players at lower levels receive reduced construction times:

| Player Level | Cost | Build Time |
|--------------|------|------------|
| 2 | 158 Wood & 83 Stone | 00:00:09 |
| 3 | 158 Wood & 83 Stone | 00:00:15 |
| 4 | 158 Wood & 83 Stone | 00:00:18 |

| 7 | 158 Wood & 83 Stone | 00:05:00 |
| 8 | 158 Wood & 83 Stone | 00:09:50 |

## Commander System

### Commander Capacity
Each Encampment level increases the number of commanders that can be deployed simultaneously:
- **Level 1**: 3 commanders available
- **Level 2**: 6 commanders available
- **Level 3**: 9 commanders available
- **Level 4**: 12 commanders available

### Commander Functions
Commanders lead armies and provide various benefits:
- **Attack Operations**: Lead offensive armies against enemy castles
- **Defensive Operations**: Strengthen castle defenses
- **Transfer Operations**: Move troops between castles
- **Support Operations**: Provide assistance to alliance members
- **Capture Operations**: Lead forces to capture and hold objectives

## Commander Mechanics

### Commander Customization
Players can customize commanders through the Encampment interface:
- **Name**: Personalize commander identity
- **Portrait/Appearance**: Visual customization options
- **Equipment**: Assign equipment for stat bonuses (if available in era)
- **Assignment**: Deploy to specific operations

### Commander Deployment
- Commanders can be assigned to armies
- Each army requires a commander to lead it
- Commander count limits simultaneous operations
- Commanders return after mission completion
- Multiple commanders enable multi-front warfare

### Commander Benefits
Commanders provide strategic advantages:
- **Leadership**: Enable army deployment
- **Tactical Bonuses**: Various combat or efficiency improvements
- **Coordination**: Manage multiple simultaneous operations
- **Flexibility**: Offensive and defensive capabilities

## Strategic Considerations

### Multiple Commanders Advantage
Higher commander capacity enables:
- **Simultaneous Attacks**: Strike multiple targets at once
- **Defensive Flexibility**: Maintain defense while attacking
- **Resource Operations**: Send farming/raiding parties while defending
- **Alliance Support**: Help allies while managing own operations
- **Quick Response**: React to multiple threats without recall delays

### Upgrading Priority
- **Level 1**: Essential early game (3 commanders for basic operations)
- **Level 2**: Significant expansion (6 commanders - double capacity)
- **Level 3**: Major tactical advantage (9 commanders - advanced operations)
- **Level 4**: End-game optimization (12 commanders - maximum flexibility)

### Commander Management
- **Reserve Commanders**: Keep some available for emergencies
- **Specialized Roles**: Dedicate commanders to specific functions
- **Rotation**: Avoid tying up all commanders in long operations
- **Priority Assignment**: Critical operations get commanders first

## Building Features

### Important Notes
- **Cannot be demolished** once built
- **Limited to 1 Encampment** per player
- **Main castle only** - cannot build in outposts
- Core military building for army management
- Essential for active military gameplay

### Placement Considerations
- Can be placed anywhere in main castle
- Does not require specific positioning
- Plan placement carefully as building is permanent

## Operational Tactics

### Attack Operations
- **Single Target Assault**: Use one commander for focused attack
- **Multi-Target Raids**: Deploy multiple commanders for simultaneous strikes
- **Wave Attacks**: Send successive waves with different commanders
- **Feint Attacks**: Diversionary attacks while main force approaches

### Defensive Operations
- **Home Defense**: Keep commanders at castle for quick response
- **Forward Defense**: Deploy to outposts for advanced warning
- **Support Defense**: Send commanders to reinforce allies
- **Quick Recall**: Maintain commander availability for emergencies

### Resource Operations
- **Farming Routes**: Assign commanders to resource collection
- **Raid Parties**: Dedicated commanders for quick resource raids
- **Supply Lines**: Manage resource transfers between castles
- **Continuous Operations**: Rotate commanders for sustained farming

## Progression Path

### Early Game (Levels 1-20)
- Build Encampment as soon as level 4 reached
- Level 1 provides basic operational capability
- Focus on learning commander mechanics
- Use commanders primarily for attacks and farming

### Mid Game (Levels 20-50)
- Upgrade to Level 2 for expanded operations
- Begin more complex multi-commander strategies
- Coordinate with alliance for group operations
- Level 3 upgrade provides significant tactical depth

### Late Game (Level 50+)
- Level 4 Encampment for maximum operational flexibility
- Sophisticated multi-front warfare capabilities
- Complex alliance warfare coordination
- Maximum strategic options available

## Commander Efficiency

### Optimal Usage
- **Don't Idle**: Always have commanders deployed
- **Plan Ahead**: Schedule operations to maximize commander utilization
- **Stagger Returns**: Avoid all commanders returning simultaneously
- **Emergency Reserve**: Keep 1-2 commanders available for urgent needs

### Common Mistakes
- Sending all commanders on long operations
- Not coordinating commander return times
- Overextending commander availability
- Poor prioritization of commander assignments

## Alliance Warfare

### Coordinated Operations
- Synchronize attacks with alliance members
- Support operations for alliance territories
- Defensive assistance for allied castles
- Resource support for alliance growth

### Strategic Value
- More commanders enable better alliance participation
- Support alliance warfare without compromising own defense
- Quick response to alliance emergencies
- Enhanced cooperation capabilities

## Economic Considerations

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Level 1**: Low cost, essential functionality - build immediately
- **Level 2**: Moderate cost, doubles capability - high value upgrade
- **Level 3**: Significant cost, 50% increase - good for active players
- **Level 4**: High cost, 33% increase - for competitive players

### Resource Investment
- Primarily Wood and Stone costs
- No ongoing maintenance
- One-time investment per level
- Consider timing with other major upgrades

### Return on Investment
- Higher commander count increases operational tempo
- More simultaneous operations improve resource generation
- Better defensive posture reduces losses
- Enhanced alliance contribution opportunities

## Historical Context

### Encampment Evolution (Pre-2018)
- Original building from game launch (pre-August 2011)
- Level cap raised from 3 to 4 in April 2014
- Core commander system mechanic
- Essential for competitive and alliance play
- Foundation of army management system

## Advanced Tactics

### Commander Specialization
- **Attack Specialists**: Commanders primarily used for offensive operations
- **Defense Coordinators**: Commanders for defensive assignments
- **Resource Collectors**: Dedicated farming commanders
- **Support Leaders**: Alliance assistance focus

### Timing Strategies
- **Staggered Deployment**: Space out commander deployment for continuous operations
- **Synchronized Strikes**: Coordinate multiple commanders for simultaneous impact
- **Quick Rotation**: Rapid commander turnover for sustained pressure
- **Patient Reserve**: Hold commanders for optimal timing

### Risk Management
- Never commit all commanders to risky operations
- Maintain home defense capability
- Balance offensive and defensive assignments
- Keep emergency response capability

## Competitive Advantages
