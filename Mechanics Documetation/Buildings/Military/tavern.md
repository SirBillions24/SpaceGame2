# Tavern

## Overview
The Tavern is a military building that sets the maximum number of spies you can dispatch for espionage and/or sabotage operations. It is crucial for gathering intelligence on enemy castles and disrupting enemy operations. The Tavern can only be built at the main castle and is limited to a maximum of 3 buildings.

## Building Levels (Classic Era)

### Level Requirements and Stats

| Level | Player Level Required | Cost | Experience Points | Available Agents |
|-------|---------------------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 7 | 145 Wood & 95 Stone | 7 | 2 |
| 2 | 20 | 2,494 Wood & 2,662 Stone | 24 | 3 |
| 3 | 30 | 5,663 Wood & 7,947 Stone | 36 | 5 |
| 4 | 65 | 74,980 Wood & 79,880 Stone | 40 | 7 |

### Low Level Construction (Accelerated Build Times)

Players at lower levels receive reduced construction times:

| Player Level | Cost | Build Time |
|--------------|------|------------|
| 7 | 145 Wood & 95 Stone | 00:04:00 |
| 8 | 145 Wood & 95 Stone | 00:09:50 |
| 9 | 145 Wood & 95 Stone | 00:15:00 |
| 10 | 145 Wood & 95 Stone | 00:20:00 |
| 11 | 145 Wood & 95 Stone | 00:25:00 |

## Spy Mechanics

### Agent Capacity
- Each Tavern level increases the number of spies available
- Can build up to 3 Taverns at main castle
- Maximum agents per Tavern at Level 4: 7 spies
- Total maximum with 3 Level 4 Taverns: 21 spies

### Spy Operations

#### Espionage
Spies can gather intelligence on enemy castles:
- **Troop Composition**: View enemy soldier types and quantities
- **Defensive Tools**: Identify defense tools deployed
- **Castle Fortifications**: Assess wall, gate, and moat strength
- **Resource Information**: Estimate available resources for looting

#### Sabotage
Spies can conduct sabotage operations:
- **Resource Destruction**: Reduce enemy resource stockpiles
- **Tool Destruction**: Destroy enemy defensive/offensive tools
- **Building Damage**: (Specific mechanics vary by game version)

### Spy Success Factors
- Number of spies sent vs. enemy counter-intelligence
- Player level vs. target level
- Random chance element
- Enemy Tavern level affects counter-intelligence

## Strategic Considerations

### Multiple Taverns Strategy
- Build all 3 Taverns to maximize intelligence operations
- Higher total spy count provides:
  - Better success rates on espionage
  - More simultaneous intelligence gathering
  - Greater sabotage capability

### Espionage Tactics
- **Pre-Attack Intelligence**: Always spy before attacking to assess defenses
- **Dummy Unit Detection**: Higher spy counts better at identifying fake troops
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track enemy troop movements and reinforcements
- **Alliance Coordination**: Share intelligence within alliance for coordinated attacks

### Upgrading Priority
- Level 1 Tavern essential early game (2 spies)
- Level 2 significant improvement (3 spies)
- Level 3 recommended mid-game (5 spies)
- Level 4 end-game upgrade (7 spies)

## Building Features

### Important Notes
- **Cannot be demolished** once built
- **Limited to 3 Taverns** per player
- **Main castle only** - cannot build in outposts
- Provides access to General's Inn (for recruiting generals)
- Part of military infrastructure

### Placement
- Can be placed anywhere in main castle
- Does not require adjacency to other buildings
- Consider aesthetic placement as cannot be removed

## Spy Management

### Dispatching Spies
- Select target castle on world map
- Choose espionage or sabotage
- Select number of spies to send
- Spies travel to target (travel time based on distance)
- Results reported back after mission completion

### Spy Reports
- Detailed report of intelligence gathered
- Success percentage indicated
- Information accuracy depends on spy success
- Failed missions provide minimal/no information

## Historical Context

### Tavern Evolution (Pre-2018)
- Original building from game launch (2011)
- Level cap raised from 3 to 4 in January 2014
- February 2013: Increased Level 1 spy count from 1 to 2 agents
- Essential building for competitive gameplay
- Core mechanic unchanged in classic era

## Tavern vs Other Intelligence Buildings

### Unique Aspects
- Only building that provides spy capacity
- Cannot be substituted by other buildings
- Required for active intelligence operations
- Complements other military buildings

### Synergy with Other Buildings
- **Encampment**: Commanders benefit from good intelligence
- **Research Tower**: Technologies may improve spy effectiveness
- **Castle Defenses**: Intelligence helps optimize defensive positioning

## Economic Considerations

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Level 1-2**: Essential upgrades, low cost, high value
- **Level 3**: Moderate cost, good return for active players
- **Level 4**: High cost, significant commitment

### Resource Investment
- Primarily Wood and Stone costs
- No ongoing maintenance costs
- One-time investment per level
- Consider resource availability before upgrading

### Multiple Tavern Investment
- First Tavern: Essential
- Second Tavern: Recommended for active players
- Third Tavern: For competitive/alliance warfare focused players

## Advanced Tactics

### Intelligence Network
- Coordinate with alliance members
- Share spy reports on key targets
- Maintain constant surveillance on threats
- Track enemy alliance movements

### Counter-Intelligence
- Your Taverns also defend against enemy spies
- Higher level Taverns improve defense against espionage
- Multiple Taverns increase counter-spy capability

### Spy Efficiency
- Send appropriate number of spies for target
- Over-sending wastes spy capacity
- Under-sending risks mission failure
- Experience helps determine optimal spy count

## Mission Types Detail

### Standard Espionage
- Reveals troop numbers and types
- Shows defensive tool deployment
- Indicates castle fortification levels
- Success rate: Moderate to High

### Deep Espionage
- More detailed information
- Harder to achieve
- Requires more spies or higher Tavern level
- Reveals enemy weaknesses

### Sabotage Operations
- Higher risk than espionage
- More easily detected
- Significant impact when successful
- Requires careful timing

## Competitive Gameplay

### PvP Considerations
- Essential for successful attacks
- Prevents costly failed assaults
- Identifies optimal attack windows
- Tracks enemy reinforcement patterns

### Alliance Warfare
- Critical for coordinated alliance attacks
- Enables strategic target selection
- Supports alliance defense coordination
- Facilitates resource raid planning

### Glory Hunting
- Identifies high-value targets
- Minimizes failed attack glory loss
- Optimizes glory point gains
- Supports efficient glory farming
