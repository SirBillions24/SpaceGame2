## Strategic Considerations

### Cost Reduction Methods
- Defense tool cost reduction build items
- Strategic placement of economic buildings

### Production Speed Increases
- **Public Order**: Higher public order increases production speed
- **Forge Building**: Increases production speed by percentage (similar to Sawmill, Stonemason, Flour Mill)
- **Research Tower**: "Workbench" research increases production speed
- Decorations with production speed bonuses

## Building Features

### Unlocks by Level
- **Level 1**: Basic wall and gate protection tools
- **Level 2**: Ranged soldier bonuses and dummy units for deception
- **Level 3**: Moat protection tools

### Important Notes
- Cannot be demolished once built
- One per castle/outpost
- Tools apply defensive bonuses when defending against attacks
- Dummy units are visible during espionage, making defense assessment more difficult for attackers

## Tool Production Interface
- Slot-based production system
- Can queue multiple tool types
